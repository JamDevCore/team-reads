# Team Reads
## Connecting teams to discuss what they read

(Work in progress - not yet released)

We believe in the power of reading, sharing knowledge and continuously learning. Team reads is aimed at enabling remote groups of people, in coming together to benefit from sharing insights and creating discussions based on what they read.

This is the React front-end of the product, connected to a serverless api running on AWS.


## Planned updates and ideas for future releases

- Multi teams
- Book summaries
- Book sorting (recently added, highest insight count, most discussions)
- Discussion sorting ^^
- Global book search
- Team biographies
- Global team search , view bio pages and more
- Private teams / public teams
- Archive old discussions
- Create platform for live discussions
- Merge identical books from the same team
- Search team books as adding and offer user to add discussion.
- User profile page (bio, most insightful book list, more..)
- Team suggestions / recommendations
- Team course list / onboarding list
- Extending 'lightbulbs' / 'ideas' based discussion rating system to show significant books, users and teams.
