# Team Reads
## Connecting teams to discuss what they read

(Work in progress - not yet released)

We believe in the power of reading, sharing knowledge and continuously learning. Team reads is aimed at enabling remote groups of people, in coming together to benefit from sharing insights and creating discussions based on what they read.

This is the React front-end of the product, connected to a serverless api running on AWS.
